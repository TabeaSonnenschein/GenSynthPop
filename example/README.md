# You can follow the example script with the data in this folder


You can add any additional variable with any type of data you have (stratified, neighborhood marginal, any combination of conditional variables). It is an iterative process that builds the sythetic population stepwise.

I recommend adding integer age distributions based on the age_group variable (potentially also based on the sex variable) if you have that data. Then you can regroup age_group based on the stratified data you have available for additional variables.
