Description: This package contains a set of functions that help prepare stratified census datasets to generate conditional propensities, 
  combines the conditional propensities with spatial marginal distributions to generate a representative population 
  and validates that the produced agents have a similar distribution as the initial spatial marginal datasets and the stratified datasets. 
  The generated population is  representative for a city or the spatial extent that is fed into the algorithms and can be used for simulation purposes, 
  such as an agent-based model. The smaller the spatial units of the spatial marginal distributions, 
  the more spatially resolved the agents will be too.
